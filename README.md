# python_multiprocess_test

Sample code showing how to use multiprocess module in python.

That is how most programs with a UI in tk and slow methods/network actions should probably be coded.

i will later split in several experiments to find the best way to pass message between the processes. for now the files are just the basic setup for spawning 4 processes, one being the controller, another the UI, another a dummy load, and an idle.
