# python_multiprocess_test

Sample code showing how to use multiprocess module in python.

## 2020

this code is 5yrs old now and I honestly do not even remember what I was trying to test/benchmark here...

the only test is using multiprocessing module, which I think is to this day the only sane way to sidestep the GIL limitations in python. meh.
